Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

404
01:13:53 --> 01:14:03

I could have taken his passport.

405

were marked bills.

Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

a national under any circumstances.

Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

439

- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

440
01:20:29 --> 01:20:39
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

441
